Note on Inflation-adjustments:

Numbers for 2013-2016 were collected from the following website:
https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/inflation-adjusted-tax-items-by-tax-year

Just find the corresponding year, click the first link, which should be 
along the lines of "Various tax benefits increase due to inflation adjustments"

To illustrate, go to 2011. Click the first link (should be this: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/in-2011-many-tax-benefits-increase-slightly-due-to-inflation-adjustments)

When reading this, you'll notice sentences like "is X, up Y from 2010". Just do 
X/(X-Y). In our case, we have 3700/(3700-50), which is roughly 1.015.

In particular, I look for this kind of sentence. 
"For tax year Y, the maximum earned income tax credit (EITC) for low- and moderate- income workers and working families rises to A, up from B in Y-1." 

Nevertheless, all numerical comparisons between years will roughly show the same proportional increase/decrease. So, doing
A/B.
